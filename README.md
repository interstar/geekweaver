GeekWeaver
==========

GeekWeaver templating language

Note : this is still very, very crude ... just in the process of cleaning up and making this work properly again.

However, if you're curious, and adventurous ... there is something to see now.

QuickStart 
----------
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. ( http://python.org/ )


    git clone https://github.com/interstar/geekweaver.git gw
    
    cd gw/quickstart/
    
    ./go.sh
    
    firefox demo/index.html
    

What did I just do?
-------------------
You grabbed a copy of GeekWeaver, went into the quickstart directory, ran the compiler on the demo file and looked at 
the result.

You should now see, in your browser a simple 2-page website created from a single GeekWeaver "program" ie. an OPML file.

It's in a frameset with a menu which lets you look at both the pages, and the logs of GeekWeaver compilation. 

You should also be able to find links to the source-code of these two pages.

The OPML file which contains the source is gwdemo.opml in the quickstart directory.

You can edit it using either http://fargo.io/ or the original OPML Editor ( http://home.opml.org/ )
